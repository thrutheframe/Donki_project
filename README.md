In 2021, I was deciding which to order from Aliexpress shop, The sherpa mini or the orbiter V1.5. I decided to go for the orbiter, and it had been a good direct drive extruder. The motor that it came with (LDO-36STH20-0504) runs too hot in Singapore environment to print PLA properly. Thing got better when I swapped it out with the LDO-36STH20-1004. 

It got me thinking, why not design my own direct drive extruder using parts that were currently available, and that is how my Donki Project started. As with any design that I make, I set out with a series of criteria:
1.	Easy to print; 
    - parts have to be printed flat as much as possible. 
    - support should be minimal with very little cleaning/post work. 
    - use basic geometry to optimise print time and path. 
2.	All parts can be printed in under 4hrs @ 0.4mm nozzle, 50mm/s speed, 0.2mm layer height. 
3.	Use existing parts; 
    - BMG / clone gears that are easily sourced. 
    - M3 screws, etc
4.	Easy maintenance;
    - quick access to the gears and clean with a brush
    - clog or jam can be qiuckly resolved.
