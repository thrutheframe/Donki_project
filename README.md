In 2021, I was deciding which to order from Aliexpress shop, The sherpa mini or the orbiter V1.5. I decided to go for the orbiter, and it had been a good direct drive extruder. The motor that it came with (LDO-36STH20-0504) runs too hot in Singapore environment to print PLA properly. Thing got better when I swapped it out with the LDO-36STH20-1004. 

It got me thinking, why not design my own direct drive extruder using parts that were currently available, and that is how my Donki Project started. As with any design that I make, I set out with a series of criteria:
1.	Easy to print; 
    - parts have to be printed flat as much as possible. 
    - support should be minimal with very little cleaning/post work. 
    - use basic geometry to optimise print time and path. 
2.	Individual parts can be printed in within 1-2hrs @ 0.4mm nozzle, 50mm/s speed, 0.2mm layer height. 
3.	Use existing parts that are easily sourced; 
    - BMG / clone gears 
    - M3 screws, etc
4.	Easy maintenance;
    - quick access to the gears and clean with a brush.
    - clog or jam can be qiuckly resolved. 
    - open area for the motor to cool better
5. Allow an ecosystem of mounts, sensors, probe and fanduct to be easily design to work with it.

The Donki comes in two versions:
1. The conventional flat mount, and 
2. The vertical mount with the clip and lock hotend bracket. 

In addition, Donki will also have its own Tiki4 mount system. It can be used on stock V-wheel carriage of the CR10/Ender printers or linear rails carriage.
