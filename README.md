### Prelude
In 2021, I was choosing between the sherpa mini or the orbiter V1.5. I got for the orbiter and it was a good direct drive extruder. The motor that it came with (LDO-36STH20-0504) runs too hot in Singapore environment to print PLA properly. Thing got better when I swapped it out with the LDO-36STH20-1004. It got me thinking, why not design my own direct drive extruder using parts that were currently available, and that is how my Donki Project started. 

### Parametes
As with any design that I make, I set out with a series of criteria:

1.	Easy to print; 
    - parts have to be printed flat on the print-bed as much as possible. 
    - support should be minimal with very little cleaning/post work. 
    - use basic geometry to optimise print time and path. 
2.	Individual parts can be printed in within 1-2hrs @ 0.4mm nozzle, 50mm/s speed, 0.2mm layer height, 5 walls and 30% infills. 
3.	Use existing parts that are cheap and easily sourced; 
    - Clone BMG gears or gut an exisiting clone bmg extruder
    - M3 screws, etc
4.	Easy maintenance;
    - quick access to the gears and clean with a wire brush.
    - clog or jam can be qiuckly resolved. 
    - open area for the motor to cool better
5.  Mounting points that is inline with the filament path, and not too wide apart to reduce mounting foot print. 
6.  Allow an ecosystem of mounts, sensors, probe and fanduct to be easily design to work with it.
\
The Donki comes in Left-handed and Right-handed version. 

I have designed the Tiki_Monocoque mount and fanduct system for ender3 and 5. It can be used on stock V-wheel carriage of the CR10/Ender printers or linear rails carriage.

#### Credits
There are many desing elements that I took from other extruders to come up with Donki. Namely Orbiter V1.5 for it robust body structure, Sherpa Mini for it gear orientation and Superfly which I liked a lot. 



### Caveat
As with all my design, it may or may not work for you, Hence, use/print it at your own discretion.
